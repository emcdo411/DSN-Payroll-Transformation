Overview
This repository supports the case study "Reinventing Payroll for Cloud-First Dental Practices" for Digital Service Network (DSN). DSN, a leader in cloud-based dental practice management, serves 500+ clinics with advanced imaging, EMR, and HIPAA-compliant tools. The case study outlines a modern payroll solution using Salesforce Data Cloud and Zoho Creator, achieving a 70% cost reduction, a 67% decrease in processing time, and enabling predictive AI analytics. The R code here generates the visualizations used in the case study to illustrate the solution's impact.
Tech Stack
The visualizations in this project were created using R in RStudio, leveraging the following technologies:

R: Core programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
RStudio: IDE for R development.
ggplot2: R package for creating elegant and customizable visualizations.
dplyr: For data manipulation (used in some graph preparations).

Installation
To run the R code and generate the graphs, ensure you have R and RStudio installed. Then, install the required packages using the commands below.
Install ggplot2

install.packages("ggplot2")

Why This Matters
The visualizations in this case study are critical for understanding the transformative impact of DSN's cloud-native payroll solution. They highlight key metrics—cost savings, processing time reduction, and scalability—that demonstrate the solution's value to both DSN and its 500+ client clinics. For DSN, the 70% cost reduction and 67% decrease in processing time mean significant operational efficiency, while the predictive AI analytics enable smarter decision-making. For client clinics, this solution offers a modern, HIPAA-compliant payroll system as a subscription service, reducing their overhead and improving workflows. These graphs provide a clear, data-driven narrative that can drive stakeholder buy-in and support DSN's expansion to 1,000+ clinics.
Conclusion
This repository provides the R code to recreate all graphs from the DSN case study, showcasing the benefits of a cloud-native payroll solution. By leveraging R and ggplot2, these visualizations offer a compelling way to communicate the project's impact.
